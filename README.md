# Ticket-Viewer

To run viewer, simply cd to the directory and type: viewer. </br>
Enter the OAuth token, as sent in the email, as is when prompted (no quotation marks). </br>
Follow the prompts to view the tickets. </br>
Currently, looking at all the tickets prints out 10 at a time because 25 was too much with the given format. </br>
</br>
If you would like to build the ticket viewer from scratch, cd to the main directory and run the command: pip install --editable . </br>
pip and python3 were required to do so.
</br></br>
To run tests, first enter the viewer source code and change the testing variable at the top to True. </br>
Then, set the token equal to the OAuth code to run the tests with the valid token and leave it equal to anything else to run the tests for an invalid token.</br>
cd to the Ticket-Viewer folder and run python3 test.py </br>
